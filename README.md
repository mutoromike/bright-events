### Link to Application: `https://bright-events-js.herokuapp.com/`

Bright events provides a platform for event organizers to create and manage different types of events while making them easily accessible to target markets. Event organizers need to register for accounts, so they can create and manage their events. Users (Event Attendees) need registration to RSVP to events.

Motivation
Events are created every day, people get to events and others get to miss event RSVP. Motivation to come up with this application has originated from the fact that people need to have access to event details from wherever they are.
